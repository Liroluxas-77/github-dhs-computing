One stormy day, I landed into an unknown space. It was so big.

I looked around and saw a big grey old man. He seemed so rocky and would be most slightly made of stone. Around him was a grasspatch of a circle shape. Could he be my kind's mortal enemy? Those who occupied Mars. If so, I was 
in great danger, they were the ones who once destroyed our home with their amazing great strength. Where am I? Could this be... MARS!! I was in great danger. I had to hide before
they awake. There was no time to waste I had to hide.

Suddenly, a shadow lurked out of the corner. This was bad!!! I tried to run but the person saw me too soon. Before I could speak, she led me to a room. It said 1H. Inside, there 
roars of laughter. There were two women standing in front of everyone. 

Then, they said," Welcome to Dunman High School! You too has been allocated to 1H. "

Finally, I came to my senses. It was orientation day. The person I met was my teacher, Ms Ng and Mdm Sim. 

They taught the class with passion, and with all their best. THANK YOU A LOT to them.

And you should know who was the mortal enemy was....
